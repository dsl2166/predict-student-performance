# Predicting Student Performance

This is a simple exercise where I predict student final course grades using
machine learning techniques that I've read about. The goal here was to get some
hands-on experience and exposure to machine learning in Python.

Data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance#).
