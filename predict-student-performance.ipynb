    "After reading a bit about machine learning and predictive modeling, I wanted to use some of these models and get some hands-on practice. I decided to try and predict student performance, namely final scores in a class, using data about Portuguese secondary students found on UCI's machine learning repository. I figured that this topic would be somewhat relevant to me since I work in the education sector.\n",

    "There are two datasets available on the machine learning repository: one with scores from a math course, another with scores from a Portuguese course. I will focus on the dataset with the Portuguese course scores. The dataset is very clean, and while I recognize that real data is never this clean, I wanted to spend more time on applying machine learning techniques than on cleaning data. \n",

By default, Scikit-Learn sets the number of trees to be 100 for the random forest regressor.\n",

    "It's possible to look at the importance of features for a random forest model. A feature's importance is calculated based on how much the tree nodes that use this feature reduce impurity on average (across all trees in the forest). Nodes are also weighted based on the number of training samples associated with it. When I plot the top 10 important features of my random forest model, `failures` is the most important feature by far with `absences` a distant second. This is not surprising to me at all. Others have noted that feature importance based on impurity can be biased since it is computed on statistics derived from the training data and suggest looking at permutation importances to mitigate these limitations. However, I think the top two most important features will still be `failures` and `absences` regardless. "

    "## Conclusion and Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the models don't seem all that great. The random forest model had the lowest RMSE at ~2.85, which means on average, the model predictions were off by ~2.85 points. This is a lot considering the scale of the final grade is only 0 to 20. Granted, my implementation is certainly not perfect and there are probably better ways or methods to go about predicting student performance. If I were interested in model performance alone, I would have also included the first period and second period grades as predictors. This would no doubt improve the performance of all the models. \n",
    "\n",
    "I do also wonder about the practical use of these models and the act of predicting student performance itself. The first thing that comes to mind is intervention and targeted supports for students in danger of failing the class or doing poorly. The question then is would using these predictive models be any better than a teacher simply looking at students' past grades and determining who needs more help. I'm not so sure that would be the case. I think there is potential in using these models to help automate targeted supports, but it would have to be very carefully implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "This was a fun exercise and I enjoyed diving into a machine learning task, even if it was a fairly simple and imperfect application. It took me longer than I expected because I ended up Googling and rereading a lot of things and second guessing myself. It turns out that reading about machine learning and predictive modeling is not that the same as applying the concepts. Who would have thought? The hyperparameter tuning was particularly time consuming, both theoretically and computationally. I wasn't really sure which numbers or how many numbers to include in the parameter grid and I'd love to develop some sort of intution about these things. "
